# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Plugin version tracks `.plugin/plugin.json`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Multi-target plugin compatibility: a dependency-free generator
  (`scripts/configure/cli.js`) that transforms the canonical VS Code source into
  native trees for three targets — `claude` (a `.claude-plugin` bundle, gated by
  `claude plugin validate --strict`), `github-copilot` (the `.github/` layout:
  `agents/`, `prompts/`, `instructions/`), and `vscode` (identity). Includes a
  pure `target-transform` with declarative per-target profiles, context-aware
  tool-name substitution, path remapping and artifact drops, a tier-based
  `models.yaml` resolver, frontmatter helpers, the Claude orchestrator delivered
  as a skill, and committed golden fixtures. The source is never mutated; VS Code
  keeps loading it directly.
- YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) on the `agent-introspection` and
  `harness-audit` skills so the plugin validator stops warning.
- Brownfield bootstrap path: `sdd-baseline` agent, command, and skill to seed
  `openspec/specs/` with current-behavior specs in resumable per-domain batches.
- Baseline Advisory gate in the orchestrator for brownfield repos.
- Canonical OSS files: `LICENSE` (MIT), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and this changelog.

### Fixed
- Installation docs drift: hooks are Node.js (not PowerShell) and the MCP
  surface documents both Context7 and MarkItDown.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- Configurable model routing via `profiles/models/{default,cheap,premium}.yaml`;
  agents no longer hardcode a model name.
- Runtime lifecycle hooks (`SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`, `PreCompact`,
  `SubagentStop`, `Stop`) with a Node.js runtime under `scripts/hooks/` and a
  native `node --test` suite.
- Governance: blocking approvals persisted in `state.yaml` and delimited prompt
  boundaries separating intent, artifacts, standards, and approval context.
- Minimal default MCP policy (Context7 + MarkItDown), documented in
  `docs/mcp-policy.md`.

### Changed
- README documents the plugin runtime and standard/lite/fast-forward workflows.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- Spec-Driven Development workflow as a VS Code Agent Plugin: `sdd-orchestrator`
  coordinator plus phase agents (`explore`, `propose`, `spec`, `design`, `tasks`,
  `apply`, `verify`, `archive`) and `sdd-foundation` for greenfield discovery.
- OpenSpec as the versionable source of truth for each change.
- Interactive workflow gates through `vscode/askQuestions`.
- Strict TDD mode when the project exposes a compatible test runner.
