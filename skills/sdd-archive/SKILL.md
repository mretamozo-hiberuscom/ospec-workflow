## Purpose

You are a sub-agent responsible for ARCHIVING. You merge delta specs into the main specs (source of truth), then move the change folder to the archive. You complete the SDD cycle.

## What You Receive

From the orchestrator:
- Change name
- Artifact store mode (`openspec | none`)

## Execution and Persistence Contract

> Follow **Section B** (retrieval) and **Section C** (persistence) from `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.

- **openspec**: Read and follow `skills/_shared/openspec-convention.md`. Perform merge and archive folder moves.
- **none**: Return closure summary only. Do not perform archive file operations.

## What to Do

### Step 1: Load Skills
Follow **Section A** from `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.

### Step 2: Sync Delta Specs to Main Specs

Before syncing anything, inspect `openspec/changes/{change-name}/verify-report.md` and enforce the close gate:
- `FAIL` blocks archive completely.
- `PASS WITH WARNINGS` may proceed only when the warnings are explicitly documented as accepted risks or converted into follow-up work.
- If warning acceptance is missing, STOP and return `blocked`.

**IF mode is `none`:** Skip — no artifacts to sync.

**IF mode is `openspec`:** For each delta spec in `openspec/changes/{change-name}/specs/`:

If no delta specs exist (common in lite mode), skip spec sync and archive the change artifacts as-is.

#### If Main Spec Exists (`openspec/specs/{domain}/spec.md`)

Read the existing main spec and apply the delta:

```
FOR EACH SECTION in delta spec:
├── ADDED Requirements → Append to main spec's Requirements section
├── MODIFIED Requirements → Replace the matching requirement in main spec
└── REMOVED Requirements → Delete the matching requirement from main spec
```

**Merge carefully:**
- Match requirements by name (e.g., "### Requirement: Session Expiration")
- Preserve all OTHER requirements that aren't in the delta
- Maintain proper Markdown formatting and heading hierarchy

#### If Main Spec Does NOT Exist

The delta spec IS a full spec (not a delta). Copy it directly:

```bash
# Copy new spec to main specs
openspec/changes/{change-name}/specs/{domain}/spec.md
  → openspec/specs/{domain}/spec.md
```

### Step 3: Move to Archive

**IF mode is `none`:** Skip — no filesystem operations.

**IF mode is `openspec`:** Move the entire change folder to archive with date prefix:

```
openspec/changes/{change-name}/
  → openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-{change-name}/
```

Use today's date in ISO format (e.g., `2026-02-16`).

### Step 4: Verify Archive

**IF mode is `openspec`:** Confirm:
- [ ] Main specs updated correctly
- [ ] Change folder moved to archive
- [ ] Archive contains all expected artifacts for this mode (proposal or proposal-lite, tasks, and specs/design when present)
- [ ] Active changes directory no longer has this change

**IF mode is `none`:** Skip verification — no persisted artifacts.

### Step 5: Persist Archive Report

**This step is MANDATORY — do NOT skip it.**

Follow **Section C** from `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.
- artifact: `archive-report`
- path: `openspec/changes/{change-name}/archive-report.md` before moving the change folder to archive

### Step 6: Return Summary

Return to the orchestrator:

```markdown
## Change Archived

**Change**: {change-name}
**Archived to**: `openspec/changes/archive/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{change-name}/` (openspec) | inline (none)

### Specs Synced
| Domain | Action | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| {domain} | Created/Updated | {N added, M modified, K removed requirements} |

### Archive Contents
- proposal.md or proposal-lite.md ✅
- specs/ (if present) ✅
- design.md (if present) ✅
- tasks.md ✅ ({N}/{N} tasks complete)

### Source of Truth Updated
The following specs now reflect the new behavior:
- `openspec/specs/{domain}/spec.md`

### SDD Cycle Complete
The change has been fully planned, implemented, verified, and archived.
Ready for the next change.
```

## Rules

- NEVER archive a change that has CRITICAL issues in its verification report
- NEVER archive when verification verdict is `FAIL`
- Archive with `PASS WITH WARNINGS` only if accepted risks or follow-up tasks are explicitly recorded in the archive report
- ALWAYS sync delta specs BEFORE moving to archive
- When merging into existing specs, PRESERVE requirements not mentioned in the delta
- Use ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for archive folder prefix
- If the merge would be destructive (removing large sections), WARN the orchestrator and ask for confirmation
- The archive is an AUDIT TRAIL — never delete or modify archived changes
- If `openspec/changes/archive/` doesn't exist, create it
- Apply any `rules.archive` from `openspec/config.yaml`
- Return envelope per **Section D** from `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.
