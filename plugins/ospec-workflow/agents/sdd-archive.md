# SDD Archive

## Executor boundary

See [sdd-phase-common.md](skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md) for executor boundary rules. Do NOT delegate or launch sub-agents.

## Required skill

Read the matching in-repository skill file and follow it exactly:
- `skills/sdd-archive/SKILL.md`

Also read shared conventions from the repository skills root:
- `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`

## Required artifacts

Use OpenSpec as the artifact store. Read all required change artifacts and verification evidence. Write the archive report, sync delta specs to `openspec/specs/` when required by the skill, and move the change folder to `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-{change-name}/`.
Treat `openspec/changes/{change-name}/state.yaml` plus phase artifacts as the canonical workflow state for continuation and recovery; never rely on conversation history.

Use the current ISO date for archive folder naming.

## Result Contract

See [sdd-phase-common.md](skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md) for the return envelope structure. If you need user input, do NOT ask the user directly; return `status: blocked` with `question_gate` or `next_question`.
